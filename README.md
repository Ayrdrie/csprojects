## PROJECT 1
  * cs210_webdev
  * This is a web development project that is a combination of DevOps tools, WordPress, PHP, and Node.  The project uses Docker to create a Wordpress environment.  The Wordpress project includes a custom REST API that ties into the Wordpress framework.  The Node Express project creates a simple REST API that interrogates the WordPress framework using the Wordpress Node API client. For more details on how to run the project see the README: https://github.com/Ayrdrie/csprojects/blob/master/cs210_webdev/README.md
